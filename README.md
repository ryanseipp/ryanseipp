### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a platform engineer operating Kubernetes environments by day.

Here, you'll find me working on:

- NixOS and Kubernetes on bare-metal: [homelab](https://github.com/ryanseipp/homelab)
- Declarative system configuration of my personal machine: [nixos](https://github.com/ryanseipp/nixos)

Prior learning projects include:

- GitOps platform with a hello-world Rust App & one command bootstrap [gitops-app-platform](https://github.com/ryanseipp/gitops-app-platform)
- Testing the performance of io_uring vs epoll: [iouring-test](https://github.com/ryanseipp/iouring-test)
- Building a simple HTTP server in Rust: [rask-old](https://github.com/ryanseipp/rask-old)

Currently building with Kubernetes, Crossplane, Rust, and Go.
